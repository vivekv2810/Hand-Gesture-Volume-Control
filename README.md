# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control
The Gesture Control System uses a webcam to detect the distance between the thumb and index finger for controlling computer volume. It leverages OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand detection, and the Pycaw library to adjust system audio, enabling users to manage volume through hand gestures.
